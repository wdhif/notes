Some Unix characteristics that are at the core of its strength:
 Unix is simple: only hundreds of system calls and have a straightforward, even basic, design. In Unix, everything is a file: simplifies the manipulation of data and devices into a set of core system calls: open(),read(), write(), lseek(), and close().</description>
